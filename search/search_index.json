The benchmark aims to evaluate Explainable AI systems, by asking a system the best fitting concept for a Learning Problem. Thus the system aims to describe the problem as best it can using an OWL ontology. What is a Learning Problem in this context? A learning problem is a set of positive examples and negative examples, whereas one example is an Individual contained in the ABox of the benchmarked OWL ontology. A learning problem may have also a gold standard concept which describes the learning problem. However a Learning Problem does not have to contain a Concept. Imagine the following Ontology Class Human Class Dragon Disjoint: Humand, Dragon Human1 is Human Dragon1 is Dragon Human2 is Human Our Learning problem is: positives: [\"Human1\"] negatives: [\"Human2\", \"Dragon1\"] There is no concept within the TBox of the ontology representing the Learning Problem fully. How does it work? Core Hobbit The RAKI ILP Benchmark is integrated into Hobbit and can be used using Hobbit. For further Information how the ILP benchmark works inside Hobbit, have a look here Where can I find the code? The code is open source at https://github.com/dice-group/raki-ilp-benchmark and you can code with us if you want to :) Where do I submit a bug or enhancement?
